# OurWebApp

## Test React App locally

### Pre-requisite

To run the front-end application (`./chess-app/`), you will need to have installed on you local machine the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Step for installation

Use the terminal/shell[^1] to run the following commands:

1. `cd ./chess-app`
2. `npm install` (if it's the first time)
3. `npm run start`

At this point, you should see in the terminal window something similar to this:

```bash
Compiled successfully!

You can now view chess-app in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.23:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
```

and probably a new browser window will be open and routed to `http://localhost:3000`, where the front-end application will be available! :)

[^1]: You can also use the built-in terminal window in VSCode
